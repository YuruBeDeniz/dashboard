## Description

This is my dashboard app where I show some widgets such as Berlin weather and a map showing my favorite boulder houses. I have also 2 trivia widgets showing a random country and wiki of the day.

## Tech Stack

JavaScript, React, CSS


## Steps
1. Find public APIs:
- Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api
- Mapbox: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/install/
- Counrtry API: https://ih-countries-api.herokuapp.com/countries

2. Create custom JSON file for boulder houses addresses

3. Fetch data with axios, show them in the components, and style them

4. Create interactive sidebar

5. Use CSS grid for the widgets
